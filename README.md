# IAC_MoonLauncher
Code for the Orbital Dynamics section of the Moon Launcher article to be presented at the 2024 IAC. This repository requires the [tudat-space](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/_src_getting_started/installation.html) to be installed since it provides many helper functions, from a SPICE Python wrapper to element conversions in the field of celestial mechanics.
